# GIS_based_house_prices_prediction
Using ML to predict housing prices on GIS data.

## ðŸš€ Background
This project is a demonstration project, showcasing house price prediction using GIS data combined with a Random Forest algorithm in machine learning. 

Due to the lack of appropriate financial data, synthetic data has been constructed. 

ðŸ¥´ As only a Mac computer is available, it's not possible to install ArcGIS for more extensive demo projects, and surprisingly, ArcGIS Online still charges a fee.

## ðŸŒ¿ Content
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the data.
- Use of the Random Forest algorithm for predictions, evaluated using the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) metric.
